Basic app
=========
	name, location, description, menu of food truck
	user login - store favorite truck (IDs) x
	location per day as mongo query x
	menu items as array of objects (first)
	authorization

Additional ideas
================
	truck randomizer
	
	map feature -- mongo query would be easier of options x

	full text search description

	truck ids to include review as an object?
