A South Lake Union food truck finder application that allows the user to login, and visualize food trucks on an interactive map. 

Additional functionality includes a randomizer button to select a random food truck and show positioning on a map.

The user is also able to select a specific date of the week that will load locations of food trucks on that day.

Finally, the user is able to select a specific type of cuisine that will populate the map with food trucks that serve that cuisine.
